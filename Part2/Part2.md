<p> As seen on the screenshots above, in the server, there were 3 threads created when 2 clients connected which makes sense since there are at least n+1 threads where n stands for number of clients. The rest 10 threads are created by the computer to handle the operations.</p>
<p>  For each client, there was 1 thread created and the rest 10 threads are created to handle the operations.</p>
